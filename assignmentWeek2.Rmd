## Assignment week 2 for course Developing Data Products -- Coursera
###Purpose: Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet.

```{r loadLibs, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
```


```{r loadData}
df<-read.csv("~/Documents/coursera/Course9-Developing-Data-Products/week2/miscanthusyield.csv")
```

The map just shows the data of "Modeling spatial and dynamic variation in growth, yield, and yield stability of the bioenergy crops Miscanthus Ã— giganteus and Panicum virgatum across the conterminous United States" by Miguez, F. E., Maughan, M., Bollero, G. A. and Long, S. P. (2012) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1757-1707.2011.01150.x/full] using a leaflet map with clustering and (once zoom-in) the circles whose radius is proportional to the yeld in the surrounding area.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
df %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addCircleMarkers( radius = df$yield, clusterOption = markerClusterOptions())
```
